# 🚀 CampusPrep — From Campus to Career

CampusPrep is an AI-powered interview preparation platform designed to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world industry expectations.

The platform follows a structured Student → Alumni → Admin → Platform Services workflow, powered by an intelligent MCP Tool (Model Control & Processing Tool) that dynamically decides interview complexity based on student readiness.
